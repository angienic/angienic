### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal project drawer, the place where I keep track of my day to day analysis while I play with my own ideas.
- ðŸ”­    I am currently working on a portfolio piece that started as part of a data science program capstone project investigating supply chains. I learned a ton! Follow this link for a sneek peak:https://angienic.github.io/My_Portfolio/
- ðŸ’¬    Ask me about what I've learned after years analyzing biological data in R or about my fun Python side projects!
- ðŸŒ±    Iâ€™m learning NLP and looking for collaborative projects.
- ðŸ“«    Feel free to reach out! I am also at linkedin.com/in/angienicolas/

Thanks for stopping by :)
